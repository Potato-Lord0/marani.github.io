# marani.github.io

Added membership prototype: registration, login, member calendar (events), and discussion board backed by a simple file-based server API for quick testing.

Run the server:

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:4242 and use the Membership section to register and access member features.
